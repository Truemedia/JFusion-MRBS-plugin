INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THIS PLUGIN

This MRBS plugin for JFusion allows connection to any MRBS site already setup on your server using any method your server supports as long as the required configuration settings are correct,
and the MRBS site is configured correctly aswell.

INSTALLING
Navigate to your Joomla administrator page (joomla/administrator) and select JFusion from the componenets dropdown and on the submenu click "Plugin manager", 
or click JFusion to go to the JFusion page and click "manage plugins". You should be able to see at the bottom 3 options for installing this plugin:

Choose any of the 3 methods to upload the plugin (with all the files still in an archive not extracted)
- Upload Package File 
- Install from directory 	  
- Install from URL 

UPLOAD PACKAGE FILE
Using this method you simply upload you plugin file (a zip file or archive of simillar variety) through the upload box which when you
click upload it will put the plugin on your server and install it.

INSTALL FROM DIRECTORY
If you already have the plugin uploaded on your site (manually taking an automatic step of the first method) you can simply point Joomla to where your plugin is by typing
a relative link and clicking install (type ../ to go up one directory).

INSTALL FROM URL
If the plugin file is located on another server you can use an absalute URL to point joomla to the file which is the same method as the second but the plugin can be
located on any server as long as it grants access to download.

CONFIGURING
Once installed the plugin just needs configuring and the settings tested to confirm it is working as intended.

Add the following code to your MRBS configuration file (config.inc.php) which is located in the folder where you installed MRBS, 
and modify the information in the variables to suit your setup (DB and secret key).
<tt>/*********************************************************************
* JFusion authentification settings (EDIT THESE SETTINGS WITH CAUTION)
*********************************************************************/
// How to validate the user/password. One of "none", "config", "db", "db_ext" (this is DEFAULT that JFusion adds), "pop3", "imap", "ldap" "nis" "nw" "ext"
$auth['type'] = 'db_ext'; 

// The server to connect to
$auth['db_ext']['db_system'] = 'mysql'; /* Or 'mysqli', 'pgsql' */
$auth['db_ext']['db_host'] = 'localhost';

// The MySQL username and password to connect with
$auth['db_ext']['db_username'] = 'root';
$auth['db_ext']['db_password'] = 'root';

// The name of the database.
$auth['db_ext']['db_name'] = 'mrbs';

// The table that holds the authentication data
$auth['db_ext']['db_table'] = 'mrbs_users';

// The names of the two columns that hold the authentication data
$auth['db_ext']['column_name_username'] = 'name';
$auth['db_ext']['column_name_password'] = 'password';

// This is the format of the password entries in the table. You can specify 'md5', 'sha1', 'crypt' or 'plaintext'
$auth['db_ext']['password_format'] = 'md5';
$auth["session"]  = "cookie";
$auth['session_cookie']['secret'] = "random_secret_numbers_and_letters_you_want_to_use";</tt>

You will also need to edit the following file of the MRBS plugin which is "user.php" located at this URL: 
"http://yoursite.com/joomladirectory/administrator/components/com_jfusion/plugins/mrbs/user.php" which will have a simillar variation on your site
where you will need to add some settings which currently need manually writing into the file, although a future update will soon make this configuration procedure unecessary.

Open this file either through an FTP client or web based file browser and change the following settings at the following lines with the settings relevant to your site.
Line 170 (<tt>$secretz = "";</tt>), inbetween the quotes ("") write the secret session key you used in your MRBS configuration file,
which was <tt>$auth['session_cookie']['secret'] = "random_secret_numbers_and_letters_you_want_to_use";</tt>

Also at Line 172 of the "user.php" file (<tt>setcookie("SessionToken", $blowfish->encrypt($token), time() + 3600*24*30, '/mrbs/web/');</tt>) replace <tt>/mrbs/web/</tt> with your MRBS directory relevant to your
websites root folder. Once these steps have been completed along with the standard JFusion configuration everything should be working fine and you should be able to now use JFusion to login, logout, and register in MRBS.
